# PyChess
A chess engine implemented in Python. This is a work in progress and not nearly done. As such, it has not been tested to gain a rating. 
This is a hobby project of a recreational player, with a daily chess rating of 1485 on chess.com at the time of writing. As such, results are not expected to be optimal.
